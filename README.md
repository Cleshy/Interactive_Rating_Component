## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS - Flexbox - CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a really great exercise for me. I watched so many tutorials about HTML - CSS and not so far started to learn JavaScript. I tried to think deeply about the solution, and not just grab the first idea.

Also, tried to implement it like a real life component, so I focused on clean code and on user experience as well. I think this is a good starting point to implement it with a backend as well.

Of course, I think the code can be much cleaner and much much more readable but I already put into some ours, to develop my thinking, and not just follow some tutorial about how to do this, or that.

Stackoverflow and Google are getting really good friends of mine. ðŸ˜€

### Continued development

Maybe the event part of JavaScript, and also so much more with cleaner CSS. This is a small project, but I already thought about how can I write CSS to let it grow, and keep myself away from refactoring and refactoring in the future.
